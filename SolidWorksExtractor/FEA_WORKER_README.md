# FEA Worker README — SolidWorks 2024 SP5 Machine

This document is the **complete operating manual** for the worker computer that
runs the FEA extractor. It is intentionally strict: do exactly what is written
here, nothing more. Improvising is what causes the source-of-truth computer to
re-do the run.

The worker does **not** modify source code. Source code lives on, and is
authored on, the other machine. The worker only:

1. pulls the latest code,
2. builds it locally,
3. runs the extractor on a part with a solved Simulation study,
4. commits the generated artifacts back through git on a worker branch.

If you find yourself wanting to edit `.cs` files or change `run_fea_extract.ps1`
to make a run "work", **stop and report back instead**.

---

## 1. Prerequisites (one-time)

These must all be true on the worker computer before the first run:

- **Operating system**: Windows 10 or Windows 11, 64-bit.
- **SolidWorks 2024 SP5** installed and licensed.
- **SolidWorks Premium or Simulation add-in license** active. The extractor
  reaches Simulation through `swApp.GetAddInObject("SldWorks.Simulation")`;
  if that returns null you have no license / the add-in is disabled.
- **.NET Framework 4.8** runtime present (default on modern Windows; the
  extractor targets `v4.8`).
- **MSBuild 16+ or Visual Studio 2019+** (Community edition is fine).
  MSBuild is what builds `SolidWorksExtractor.csproj`. Locate it under
  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\<ver>\<edition>\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe`
  or install Visual Studio Build Tools.
- **Git for Windows** on `PATH`. The extractor records `git rev-parse HEAD`
  into the manifest as the worker's provenance — without git on PATH, the
  manifest's `extractor_git_commit` will be `null`.
- **PowerShell 5.1+** (default on Windows 10/11).
- **Write access to the local clone** of this repo (you will commit back).

---

## 2. One-time setup

1. Clone the repo to a path **without exotic characters** (avoid OneDrive
   paths if you can; if not, use the same OneDrive root we use here).

   ```powershell
   git clone <repo-url> C:\src\AI-tool
   cd C:\src\AI-tool
   ```

2. Build the extractor in **Debug** configuration:

   ```powershell
   & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\<ver>\<edition>\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" `
     SolidWorksExtractor\SolidWorksExtractor.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug /v:minimal
   ```

   You should see `SolidWorksExtractor -> ...\bin\Debug\SolidWorksExtractor.exe`
   at the end. One pre-existing `CS0618` warning about `HoleGroup.Diameter` is
   expected and unrelated.

3. **Do not** copy `SolidWorksExtractor.exe` out of the repo. It loads C# code
   that resolves SolidWorks interop assemblies via paths the project knows;
   running it from a non-repo location is unsupported. The runner script
   always invokes `SolidWorksExtractor\bin\Debug\SolidWorksExtractor.exe`
   relative to the repo root — keep it that way.

4. Open SolidWorks 2024 manually once, accept any first-run dialogs, and make
   sure the Simulation tab is enabled in `Tools → Add-Ins`.

---

## 3. Per-run workflow (every part, every study)

### Step A — Pull the latest code

```powershell
cd C:\src\AI-tool
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull
```

### Step B — Rebuild if Step A changed any `.cs` file

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\<ver>\<edition>\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" `
  SolidWorksExtractor\SolidWorksExtractor.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug /v:minimal
```

### Step C — Open the part in SolidWorks and verify the study is solved

- Open the `.SLDPRT` in SolidWorks 2024.
- In the Simulation tab, verify the study you intend to extract has a
  green checkmark (i.e. results are computed). If it does not, **solve it
  first inside SolidWorks**. The extractor explicitly rejects unsolved
  studies in explicit-selection mode (this is intentional; do not work
  around it).

### Step D — Run preflight (always — sanity-checks env + lists studies)

```powershell
.\scripts\run_fea_extract.ps1 -Active -Preflight
```

You will see:

- SolidWorks version
- Document path
- Simulation add-in availability — **must be `available`**, otherwise stop
- Studies table with index, name, type, results yes/no

If `Simulation add-in` shows `NOT available`, **stop**. Do not proceed. Fix
the license / add-in activation in SolidWorks.

### Step E — Run the extraction with **explicit study selection**

Choose the study by **name** (preferred) or by **index**:

```powershell
# By name (preferred — name is meaningful and survives re-ordering in SW)
.\scripts\run_fea_extract.ps1 -Active -PartNumber 1234567 -StudyName "Static 1"

# By index (only when name is unstable or contains characters that confuse the shell)
.\scripts\run_fea_extract.ps1 -Active -PartNumber 1234567 -StudyIndex 0
```

The runner script enforces explicit selection and **refuses to run without a
selector**. If you genuinely want the legacy "first completed static study"
fallback, opt in with `-AllowImplicit` — but that is reserved for special
situations. The selection mode is recorded in the manifest's
`study.selection_mode` field (`"explicit-name"`, `"explicit-index"`, or
`"implicit"`) so the reviewer on the source-of-truth machine can spot any
implicit run on review.

Every successful run lands in the canonical staging directory:

```
incoming_fea\<part-slug>\<study-slug>\
```

regardless of which selector you used. The runner extracts into a temp
directory under `incoming_fea\.staging\` first, reads the manifest the
extractor produces to discover the real `<study-slug>`, then moves the
four artifacts into the canonical directory. There is no `by_index_<n>` or
`by_implicit_selection` placeholder in the committed layout.

If the canonical directory already contains artifacts (you are re-running
the same part + study combination), the script **refuses** to overwrite
unless you also pass `-Force`. Without `-Force` it exits with code 3 and
leaves the new artifacts in the temp staging directory for inspection.
This is intentional: re-runs of the same study should be deliberate, not
accidental, because they destroy prior provenance.

(See `incoming_fea/README.md` for the exact filename contract.)

### Step F — Sanity-check the manifest

Open the `*_manifest.json` file the script reports. Verify:

- `study.name` matches the SolidWorks study you chose.
- `study.selection_mode` is `"explicit-name"` or `"explicit-index"`,
  **not** `"implicit"` (unless you intentionally used `-AllowImplicit`).
- `solidworks_version` is the version you ran on.
- `extractor_git_commit` is a real SHA, not `null`. If it is null, install
  git or add it to PATH and rerun.
- `warnings` list does not contain anything alarming. The two known-always
  warnings are:
  - `"Per-node strain (max_strain_node) is not exposed via the COSMOSWorks API; left null."`
  - `"Load/fixture entity_kind (face/edge/vertex) is not exposed via the COSMOSWorks API; left null on every item."`
  Anything else (especially `Could not get reaction forces`, `GetTranslationalDisplacement failed`, etc.) is a real signal — flag it in the commit message.

### Step G — Commit and push on a worker branch

Branch name format: `fea-worker-run-YYYYMMDD` (one branch per day is fine).

```powershell
git checkout -b fea-worker-run-2026-04-24
git add incoming_fea\1234567\static_1\
git commit -m "fea: 1234567 / Static 1 — worker run 2026-04-24"
git push -u origin fea-worker-run-2026-04-24
```

**The only files you should commit are inside `incoming_fea/`.** No source
edits. No `bin/` artifacts. Use `git status` before staging to be sure.

---

## 4. Inspect-only modes (no extraction)

```powershell
# Preflight (env + studies, no extraction)
.\scripts\run_fea_extract.ps1 -Active -Preflight

# List studies in the active doc
.\scripts\run_fea_extract.ps1 -Active -ListStudies

# Same against a file path instead of the active doc
.\scripts\run_fea_extract.ps1 -PartFile "C:\parts\Mounting Plate.SLDPRT" -Preflight
```

Inspect-only modes can run on any document and never write to `incoming_fea/`.

---

## 5. Strict rules (do not break these)

1. **Do not modify source code.** Code lives on the source-of-truth computer.
   Worker commits should only contain `incoming_fea/...` files.
2. **Do not skip preflight on a new part.** It's the only way to confirm the
   Simulation add-in is reachable before you spend time on extraction.
3. **Always use explicit study selection** (`-StudyName` or `-StudyIndex`).
   `-AllowImplicit` is opt-in only and should be rare.
4. **Do not solve studies via the runner script.** The extractor reads
   results; it does not solve. If a study is unsolved, solve it **inside
   SolidWorks** first — the explicit-selection path will refuse it otherwise.
5. **Do not edit the generated artifacts.** If something looks wrong, leave
   it as-is and report. Hand-editing destroys provenance.
6. **Do not copy `SolidWorksExtractor.exe` out of the repo.** Always run it
   from `bin/Debug/`. The runner script enforces this.
7. **Do not rebuild in Release** unless explicitly told to. The repo is on
   Debug builds for everyone today.
8. **Do not commit anything from `bin/`, `obj/`, `.vs/`, or other build
   output.** `git status -s` should show only `incoming_fea/...` paths
   before you commit.
9. **Do not run `--batch-parts` on a folder of parts in this stage.** FEA
   batching is out of scope; the runner script + extractor are designed for
   one part / one study per invocation.

---

## 6. Filename + manifest contract (cheat sheet)

For one extraction run, the staging directory contains exactly:

```
incoming_fea\<part-slug>\<study-slug>\
  <PartNumber>.json                                — standard part data
  <PartNumber>_fea_<study-slug>.glb                — stress-coloured surface mesh + morph target
  <PartNumber>_fea_<study-slug>_results.json       — schema v2 results
  <PartNumber>_fea_<study-slug>_manifest.json      — provenance manifest
```

Manifest top-level fields (manifest_version `"1"`):

- `timestamp_utc`, `extractor_version`, `extractor_git_commit`, `solidworks_version`
- `source.document_path`, `source.part_number`
- `study.name`, `study.slug`, `study.index`, `study.type`, `study.selection_mode`
- `outputs[]` — list of generated filenames in this directory
- `summary.{max_von_mises_mpa, max_displacement_mm, safety_factor, yield_strength_mpa, material, surface_node_count, element_count, has_morph_target}`
- `warnings[]` — any non-fatal extraction warnings collected during the run

Results JSON top-level fields (schema_version `"2"`):

- v1 compat: `study_name`, `study_type`, `units`, `summary`, `has_morph_target`
- v2 expansion: `study`, `units_detail`, `material`, `mesh`, `loads[]`, `fixtures[]`, `results`, `warnings[]`

If a field is `null` in the JSON, it means the COSMOSWorks API did not
expose that value during this run — never invented or guessed.

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

- **"Extractor not built"** — Step 2 not done. Run MSBuild.
- **"Simulation add-in NOT available"** — License or add-in not active.
  Open SolidWorks → Tools → Add-Ins → enable "SolidWorks Simulation".
  Confirm a Simulation license is checked out (Tools → License).
- **"No study named 'X' was found"** — The exact name (case-insensitive)
  did not match any study. Run `-ListStudies` to see the canonical names.
- **"Study 'X' rejected: analysis type is 'frequency' (need 'static')"** —
  You picked a non-static study; explicit selection is static-only by
  design. Pick the right study or accept that it cannot be extracted.
- **"Study 'X' rejected: no results available — study has not been solved"** —
  Solve the study **inside SolidWorks** first.
- **`extractor_git_commit` is null in manifest** — git not on PATH on the
  worker. Install Git for Windows and rerun.
- **Filenames have unexpected slugs** — Check the SolidWorks study name.
  The slug is `MakeStudySlug(study.Name)`: lowercase ASCII alphanumerics,
  hyphens preserved, everything else becomes `_`, runs collapsed,
  64-char cap, fallback `study_<index>` for empty.
- **Runner exits with code 3** — Canonical directory `incoming_fea\<part-slug>\<study-slug>\`
  already exists and contains artifacts from a prior run. Either remove that
  directory and re-run, or pass `-Force` if you intentionally want to overwrite
  prior provenance. The newly extracted artifacts are left in
  `incoming_fea\.staging\<part>-<timestamp>\` for inspection.
- **`incoming_fea\.staging\` is non-empty in the steady state** — A prior
  extraction failed or was interrupted before relocation. Inspect the
  contents, then delete the orphan staging dir before re-running.

---

## 8. What "done" looks like for a single run

After Step G:

- A new branch `fea-worker-run-YYYYMMDD` exists on origin.
- That branch has exactly one commit, touching only files under
  `incoming_fea/<part-slug>/<study-slug>/`.
- The reviewer on the source-of-truth computer can:
  - check out the branch,
  - read the manifest,
  - cross-reference `solidworks_version` + `extractor_git_commit`,
  - confirm `study.selection_mode` is `explicit-name` (not `implicit`),
  - look at the results JSON values against the SolidWorks Simulation
    report you ran on,
  - decide whether to merge the branch and surface the artifacts to the app.
